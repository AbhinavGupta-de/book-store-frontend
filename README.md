# BooksStore - A simple book store application

## Description

This is a simple book store application that allows users to add books, edit books, delete books to the store and also allows users to view the books in the store. This application is built using MERN stack.

## Why I built this project

I built this project to get more experience with the MERN stack and also to get more experience with React. I also built this project to get more experience with using MongoDB.

Apart from this, I can use this project to where I can add more features to it, like user authentication, user authorization, etc. I can also use this project to learn more about React and MongoDB.

What I have in my mind is that they can also use this site to store their reading list and add their view to any particular book just so that they can view it themselves and possibly share it with others.

## Features
